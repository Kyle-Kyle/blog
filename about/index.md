# whoami
Yo! My name is Kyle, aka @kylebot.
I'm a member of Shellphish CTF team. I'm interested in pwning, reversing and sometimes even crypto.
I'm also a PhD student enduring the unbearable heat at Arizona State University :)


# like & hate
CTF is my favorite.
I also like computer games but don't have much time for them. Sad story. At least I like collecting them in my Steam library.

I don't hate many stuff, but I hate Windows. No offence, but Windows sucks ;)
