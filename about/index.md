# About Me
I'm Yihui (Kyle) Zeng -- a PhD student of [School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/) at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/) (ASU). My primary advisor is [Dr. Tiffany Bao](https://www.tiffanybao.com/), but I also actively work with [Dr. Yan Shoshitaishvili](https://yancomm.net/), [Dr. Ruoyu (Fish) Wang](https://rev.fish/), and [Dr. Adam Doupé](https://adamdoupe.com/). I currently work at [SEFCOM](https://sefcom.asu.edu/) with a group of amazing cybersecurity researchers. My research focuses on system security, especially on automated program analysis and vulnerability discovery. I was an intern at University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) under the supervision of [Dr. Giovanni Vigna](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~vigna/) and [Dr. Christopher Kruegel](https://engineering.ucsb.edu/people/christopher-kruegel) in 2018.

I am a core member of the [Shellphish](https://shellphish.net/) CTF team, under the handle "kylebot". I'm crazy about CTF. I do PWN, Reversing, and sometimes a little bit of Web and Crypto. I have participated [DEF CON CTF](https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-ctf.html) and entered the finals every year since I joined the team in 2018. Every year, I organize [iCTF](https://ctftime.org/event/1339/), one of the largest attack-defense hacking competition in the world.

I am active in the open-source community: I am a core developer of the binary analysis platform [angr](https://angr.io/), leading the development of the automatic exploitation generation framework [rex](https://github.com/angr/rex), maintaining the popular educational heap exploitation project [how2heap](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap), and [more](https://github.com/Kyle-Kyle).

Recently, under Google's [kCTF VRP](https://google.github.io/kctf/vrp.html) program, I successfully performed Container Escape **twice** in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) ~~(and won a lot of cash)~~.
