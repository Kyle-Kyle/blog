What is going on with the upper slot? (at the point of mid_tfd allocation)
1. it is an empty slot (queued after it):
	* identify: after mid_tfd allocation, do timerfd defragmentation + close tfd should crash the kernel
	* fix: after identifying the mid_tfd, leak heap addr and then spray a fix (debug locally), and then close mid_tfd should succeed
2. it is a chunk occupied by something but then freed later
	* fix: do the same, but with a small timeout (3s?)
[LIKELY NOT] 3. it is a chunk occupied by something, never freed, and never used as well
	* after identifying mid_tfd, do timerfd defragmentation directly, (maybe fencing as well), then close(mid_tid) should not crash


[NOPE] 4. it is a chunk occupied by something and this something will use the data
	* very unlikely, this means kernel should panic at getchar() after mid_tfd allocation
[NOPE] 5. (?) it is a chunk occupied by something and this something will use the data, but it happens to use the NULL fields:
	* try different objects to occupy the middle slot, it should crash for some objects
